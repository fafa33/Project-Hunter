# Architecture Decision Index

## Purpose

This index is the central navigation and traceability registry for Architecture Decision Preparation Records (ADPRs), Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), governing Issues or Epics, implementation Pull Requests, merge commits, validation state, and releases.

It creates no independent architecture or governance authority. Canonical authority remains with the documents and ADRs linked here.

## Status Vocabulary

Use only the lifecycle states defined by `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_PREPARATION_GUIDE.md`:

- `PROPOSED`
- `IN_RESEARCH`
- `READY_FOR_REVIEW`
- `APPROVED`
- `IMPLEMENTED`
- `VALIDATED`
- `SUPERSEDED`
- `ARCHIVED`

## Decision Registry

| ADPR | Title | Status | Epic | Issue | ADR | Implementation PR | Merge commit | Release | Supersedes | Superseded by |

## Active Preparation Records

Records in `PROPOSED`, `IN_RESEARCH`, or `READY_FOR_REVIEW` state are listed here for navigation.

| ADPR | Title | Status | Blocking questions | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Approved and Implemented Records

| ADPR | ADR | Status | Implementation | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Superseded and Archived Records

| ADPR | Final status | Successor | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|

## ADR Mapping

| ADR | Governing ADPR | Decision scope | Current status |
|---|---|---|---|

## Epic and Issue Mapping

## Component Mapping

| Component or architectural area | Active ADPRs | Accepted ADRs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery | | | |
| Validation | | | |
| Evidence | | | |
| Valuation | | | |
| Opportunity assessment and ranking | | | |
| Historical validation and replay | | | |
| Persistence and correction | | | |
| Automation and operations | | | |
| Governance | | | |

## Maintenance Rules

- Add an entry when an ADPR number is allocated.
- Update status when an ADPR changes lifecycle state.
- Add ADR, PR, commit, validation, and release links only after those artifacts exist.
- Mark absent artifacts as `not applicable` or `not yet created`; never fabricate links.
- Preserve superseded and archived records.
- Keep ADPR and ADR numbers independent.
- Treat this file as a navigation registry, not as a substitute for the linked records.
- Validate links and status consistency during architecture review and final validation.
